# CS1028 Python tutorials
This repository contains solutions to some of the tutorial questions
for CS1028 course at the University of Aberdeen, fall 2019/20.

It also provides code samples with extensive explanations.
These concern some of the basic concepts in Python and programming in general.
They are meant to address some of the most frequently occurring issues.

## Using the repository
Producing well-described solutions takes time.
Seemingly the most difficult questions will be prioritised.

The students are encouraged to submit requests for solutions to specific questions
using the issue tracker (https://github.com/animaviridis/python-tutorials/issues).
The best way to do it is to create an issue with label `enhancement`.
Questions concerning existing solutions can be given the `question` or `help needed` label, etc.

Naturally, students can also send an e-mail to the tutors or just approach them during the classes.
